    <h2> About Me: </h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kery. I was born in the Dominican Republic but currently reside in the city of dreams New York. While New York may not have been exactly what I had envisioned, it is a place where dreams come true for those who are willing to put in the hard work and determination. And that's exactly what I'm planning on doing.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for helping people and making a positive impact in their lives. Whether it's through volunteering, mentoring, or simply lending a helping hand, I find joy in supporting others and making a difference. There's something fulfilling about seeing someone succeed or overcome challenges with a little guidance and support.</p>
    <p>On this website, I aim to share my experiences and resources to inspire others on their own journeys.</p>
